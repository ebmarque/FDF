## 🔑 Key Features

- **Height Map to 3D**: Turn 2D maps into 3D wireframe models.
- **Interactive Views**: Rotate, zoom, and pan to explore your models from any angle.
- **Customizable**: Change wireframe colors, thickness, and more.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Smooth and responsive visualization.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on multiple platforms.

## 💡 Project Motivation

Why did we create FDF? Because traditional 2D maps just don't cut it. We wanted a way to see terrain in 3D, making it easier to understand and analyze. Perfect for geographers, architects, game developers, and more!

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

- **Language**: Built in C for speed and efficiency.
- **Graphics**: Uses MiniLibX library for rendering.
- **Algorithm**: Combines Bresenham's line algorithm with matrix transformations.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Start with a height map file.
2. **Data Parsing**: Read and store the data in a 2D array.
3. **3D Transformation**: Convert 2D points into 3D coordinates.
4. **Wireframe Generation**: Draw lines between points to create the wireframe.
5. **Rendering**: Display the model and interact with it.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- **Texture Mapping**: Add textures for a more realistic look.
- **Shading Techniques**: Improve visual depth with shading.
- **UI Improvements**: Make the interface even more user-friendly.
- **Performance Boosts**: Optimize for larger and more complex models.

## 🎉 Conclusion

The FDF Project transforms your 2D height maps into dynamic 3D wireframes. It's perfect for anyone looking to explore terrain data in a new, engaging way. Whether for work, study, or fun, FDF brings your data to life!
